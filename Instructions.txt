Below are the following requriements needed to setup the project:
- Installing NodeJS
- Installing Python with PIP
Confirm that you have installed NodeJS and Python by running the following commands in your terminal:
```node --version```
```python --version```
```pip --version```
Extract the file, open the project in IDE of your choice, I am using VSCODE.
When the project is opened, you will find 4 folders, namely: chatbot-admin, chatroom, client, server.
To open the project on the website, there are some dependencies that need to be installed.
Open the terminal on the root of the project (which means you are in chatbot folder).
Run the following command on the terminal making sure the terminal is on the root of the project:

Setting up server side (backend of application), making sure you have already installed python and pip.
```cd server```
```python reqs.py```
```python server.py```
If you see the below on the terminal, it means the server is running:
 * Serving Flask app 'server'
 * Debug mode: on
INFO:werkzeug:WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080

If any error are found in the terminal, they will probably be missing dependencies, install them using pip.
Open a new terminal, dont close the previous terminal since the server is running on that.
Setting up client side (frontend of application)
```cd client```
```npm install```
```npm run build```
```npm start```
Open the browser and type http://localhost:3000/

The chatroom is seperate component of the application,
Open a new terminal
Server side of chatroom (backend of chatroom)
```cd chatroom```
```cd server```
```npm install```
```nodemon index.js```
Open a new terminal, dont close the previous terminal since the server is running on that.
Client Side of chatroom (frontend of chatroom)
```cd chatroom```
```cd client```
```npm install```
```npm start```

Admin panel is a seperate website and it is completly independent of the main website. To open it
Run the following commands on the terminal mqking sure the terminal is on the root of the project:
```cd chatbot-admin```
```npm install```
```npm run build```
```npm start```
